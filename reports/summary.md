# Project Summary

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of a large-scale COVID-19
patient dataset from Mexico, containing over 14 million records collected
between 2021 and 2022.

The main objective of the analysis is to identify demographic and clinical
patterns associated with mortality, with a focus on understanding how age,
sex, patient type, and pre-existing conditions relate to death outcomes.

## Dataset Overview

- Records: 14,000,000+ patient-level observations
- Time period: January 2021 – June 2022
- Data type: Structured clinical and demographic data
- Source: Public health surveillance records

## Analytical Approach

The analysis followed a structured pipeline:

1. Initial dataset inspection and technical preprocessing to enable loading
   and visualization of large-scale data.
2. Dedicated data cleaning and variable standardization.
3. Exploratory data analysis focusing on univariate and bivariate patterns.
4. Descriptive comparison of mortality rates across demographic and clinical
   groups.

No causal inference or predictive modeling was performed at this stage.

## Key Insights

- Mortality rates increase significantly with age, particularly among
  individuals over 60 years old.
- Male patients show higher mortality rates compared to female patients.
- Hospitalized patients exhibit substantially higher mortality than ambulatory
  cases.
- Chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular
  disease, and chronic renal disease are associated with increased mortality.

## Project Outputs

- Jupyter notebooks documenting each stage of the analysis
- Cleaned and optimized datasets for analysis
- Visual summaries highlighting key demographic and clinical patterns
- A conclusions report summarizing the main findings and methodological notes

This project demonstrates practical handling of large real-world datasets,
clear analytical structuring, and responsible exploratory analysis.
